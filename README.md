# Logviewer2
## A customized version of kyb3r's logviewer
### All frontend work/code related to formating + data manipulation is from [kyb3r's](https://github.com/kyb3r) repo for [logviewer](https://github.com/kyb3r/logviewer) and is clearly labled in each file's header

This is a fork (remake) of kyb3r's modmail with some changes + additions made myself for those in my staff teams to use and for anyone else that would like to use it :)

Companion plugin that can be used with this (Optional):
